## About Me
Hi! My name is **Austin Zhuang**, and I go to The Haverford School.

## About the Project
The project's title is *undecided*, but it will hopefully be about mental health

### Goals
* Visualize data on factors that lead to mental health
  + Creating the correct labels that tell the clearest story
* Use visualizations to promote mental health awareness
